### It says I don't have water or fertilizer
Go to ```lation_weed/config/config.lua``` line 15, is metadata set to true? If so, this is why. You cannot spawn the water or fertilizer item(s)
if you have metadata enabled. The items must be purchased from the "Smoke on the Water" supply shop, then try again.

### I don't get the joint or bag items when rolling or bagging
Go to ```lation_weed/config/config.lua``` line 15, is metadata set to true? If so, this is why. You cannot spawn the bud item(s) if you
