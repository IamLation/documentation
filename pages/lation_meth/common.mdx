## Issues
Find solutions and troubleshooting tips to common issues below.

### TextUI does not go away
You are on an outdated version of ```ox_lib``` and must update to the [latest](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest).

### No such export ClearStash in resource qb-inventory
You are on an outdated version of ```qb-inventory``` and must update to the [latest](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-inventory).

### SCRIPT ERROR: ?:-1 attempt to compare nil with number
You are obtaining the chemical items (*ammonia, iodine or acetone*) incorrectly. **You cannot spawn these items**.
You must obtain them properly to ensure their metadata is intact. To do this, simply spawn the ```ls_supply_crate```
and open them until you got the items you need.

### I'm using ox_core and my items don't work
