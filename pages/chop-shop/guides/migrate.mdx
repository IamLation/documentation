## Upgrade to v2

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    This guide is **only** for users upgrading from v1 to v2 - if this is your first time installing ```lation_chopshop``` or you are already on v2, this guide is **not** for you.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Enter maintenance mode (optional)

Placing your server into maintenance mode is recommended, but not required.
This is done just to ensure no players are performing any activities that may
involve database interactions and cause any delays, conflicts, etc.

To enter maintenance mode, navigate to ```txAdmin -> Settings -> Whitelist``` and select the option found below:

### Install the new ```lation_chopshop``` update

1. Remove (*and backup*) your current ```lation_chopshop``` resource from your server
2. Download the latest update from your [Cfx.re Portal/Keymaster](https://portal.cfx.re/assets/granted-assets) account
3. Extract the resource into your server as normal/update as usual
4. Once successfully installed, restart your server while still in maintenance mode.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    You **must** do a full server restart after installing before proceeding below.  
    Do not make any changes to the resource just yet, including the config file(s).
</Callout>

### Execute the migration command

Once your server has fully restarted, you can now execute the ```migrateChopshopData``` command.
This command must be typed directly into your live server console on txAdmin, like below:

If you see the message above; great job! Your player(s) data has been converted successfully to v2.

### Complete the upgrade process

After executing the above command, we can now clean up and complete this process.

As stated in the console message, you can now remove the original ```lation_chopshop``` database table or you may retain it for record purposes - up to you!

It is highly recommended after completing these steps that you do remove the command from ```lation_chopshop/server/functions.lua``` file found on line(s) 250-333.

Lastly, you can now safely exit maintenance mode (*if applicable*), restart your server & you are done!
